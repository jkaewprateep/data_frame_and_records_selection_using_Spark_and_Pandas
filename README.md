# Data frame and records selection using Spark and Pandas - notes
Data frame and records selection using Spark and Pandas

👧💬 🎈 Communication needs to identify the status of the message, we understand that Ops codes and customer messages are for error message returns from programs only but it is not. Sometimes in the communication, we need to identify the question type, destination system, the status of codes, and readiness and we can examples of communication data of interfaces APIs that do not provide mapping functions or status query messages but we need to design actions responses from the Ops codes and list of action response available or conditions agreement it equivalent to state message communication now. The statistics server or message server returns of acknowledgment message when requested and it creates notify message to the registered interface registration when it is ready to respond to allow the client to select an action or plan to read from the matrix output. </br>

## Ops codes and message description for data query and communications

🧸💬 Some programmers had a misunderstanding about the Ops codes, it is not only return error codes or error handlings but the server and client have agreements method design and they can select matching with priority message return, registered interfaces can select to use or determine their action responses. </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Many systems use Ops codes or some developers call them Opssec codes, integration data and communication development required of sample messages communication response and meaning but for DevSecs codes they are not required because of selection of action response are in the specification document and available of the system and resource are determined by the response codes. The Programmer can have a set of copies of the programming events and communication messages but only specific programs can communicate with the system efficiently. The understanding of DevOps engineering in some organizations is not only development manager, customer requirements negotiation, and IT project development but also working at the communication level of application environments and user environments. </br> 
🦤💬 Ops codes are also used for facilities for scopes of terminal communication when message types and responses are determined at application level and registration device types. What is the difference of information, debug information, and information priority⁉️  Is the information priority equivalent to the registration message⁉️ When there is similar priority came to network devices how to select information response and an example of communication register message and call for transfer that reduce many of duplicated messages. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ Do you mean transfer messages never leave from devices when there is not registered ⁉️ and there is no request to create communication devices by none-communication device type from unexpected ⁉️ ( wide ranges communications ) </br>
🦤💬 This is an example of communication message flow control and that is possible when the message loop replays inside the networks. No, it will not respond to different Ops code messages. ( narrows band communications ) </br>

## Sample application using stage message-testing ( 2020 C# state message event listener Genesis client secured communications )

🥺💬 Communication devices registration and event listeners will look like the sample code in the message below, it is working at the event message level with an event message generator, and someone at the previous company had knowledge about this type of programming that is for communication applications which is unique for client desktop. He makes a lot of money from them at the time before event messages communication with multi-variances type of message listeners are working with easy as in current. </br>

## 🧸💬 Session registration and do not forget to close and dispose of it before leaving the next station can work with performance

```
spark = SparkSession \
    .builder \
    .appName("Python Spark DataFrames basic example") \
    .config("spark.some.config.option", "some-value") \
    .getOrCreate()
```

## 🧸💬 Read .csv data, custom data class or data module can perform

```
mtcars = pd.read_csv('https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-BD0225EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/data/mtcars.csv')
```

## 🧸💬 Create dataframe

```
sdf = spark.createDataFrame(mtcars)
```
