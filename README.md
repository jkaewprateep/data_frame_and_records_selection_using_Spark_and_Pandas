Data frame and records selection using Spark and Pandas

ðŸ‘§ðŸ’¬ ðŸŽˆ Communication needs to identify the status of the message, we understand that Ops codes and customer messages are for error message returns from programs only but it is not. Sometimes in the communication, we need to identify the question type, destination system, the status of codes, and readiness and we can examples of communication data of interfaces APIs that do not provide mapping functions or status query messages but we need to design actions responses from the Ops codes and list of action response available or conditions agreement it equivalent to state message communication now. The statistics server or message server returns of acknowledgment message when requested and it creates notify message to the registered interface registration when it is ready to respond to allow the client to select an action or plan to read from the matrix output. </br>
